# Image downloader tool

## Problem

Here at *Advertising Startup* we have to work with stock images all the time. The Image downloader CLI tool downloads any JPG from a given URL. Additionally it can take file names to name the downloaded image as a flag `-file`

## Usage

1. Clone the repo.
2. Call the CLI using `./getImage -url=<URL> -file=<file>`
